Design Patterns implemented in the project:
Facade : The facade.java is implementing the logic for facade pattern. I have implemented login, product menu, product list in this class.

Bridge : A bridge pattern is implemented for loading saperate menus for buyer and sellers. For example if a buyer is logged in he will be able to choose among meat and produce products, and same for the seller.

Factory : The factory is used for selecting based on the login(whether it is buyer or seller). This changes are made in the facade.java class

Iterative : The iterator pattern is used for iterating the product elements, implementing them using its abstract methods. Its implemented in productIterator.java class and it is called in buyer.java and seller.java classes.
